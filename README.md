# Metro for you

    The main idea

As we all know, all the common ideeas will try to make a better collaboration between Metro and the consumers, or Metro and the producers. In this application, we wanted to emphasize the bond between consumers and producers, granting them a great opportunity to improve their experience, all thanks to Metro. The interraction is based on a review-reward application, when the customer is able to access all the purchase history in the last month, using his matro card, and to rate the products in terms of price and quality. Using this feature, 
the author of the rate will be given an amout of virtual coins which will help him to earn promotion products. Also, the reward system is
bifunctional, because the producers will be sorted using their personal rating, which will be increased or decreased based on the user's reviews. If one of them has a rating that is beyond a limit, they will receive special offers too. By rating the producers, we will have a better knowledge about the quality of the products. By this result and by giving our reviewers a special prize for their contribution, we will keep them close to the shop. After a long time, we will collect data that helps improving the understanding of customer's needs. 

    Opportunities to advance
    
 If the application will grow, we thought about many opportunities to make it better, such as:
 
  - scanning the bar code on the receipt to keep the procedure more simple;
  - extending the knowledge area of the customer, being able to see where the product that he bought are made, together with some information about the producers (the safety of the products in our client's minds is one of the most important things to consider);
  - collecting data about what motivates and what is considered more valuable by our customers, so we can extand the application into a global one, granting access to other big supermarkets for a fee, all being coordinated by Metro systems;
  - suggestions for products based on your previous purchases or the things you like/do in general.
  
        Notes
    
This project was made in a 24 hours long Hackathon organized by DevHacks and sponsored by Metro Systems, by a team of 4 students in the 3rd year. The user interface isn't tied with the implementation, because of the taught time, but we made it separately. We were running out of time and because of that we were forced to keep all the methods and variables public to everyone, giving just an example of how it should work. Also, the information are permanently stocked in some text files and are updated every time we open the application. The link with the implementation and the user interface design can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9fm35s7ku0b3v5f/DevHacks2018.rar?dl=0
